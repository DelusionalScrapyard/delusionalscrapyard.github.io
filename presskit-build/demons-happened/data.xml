  <description>Demons Happened is a challenging top down shooter with puzzle/platforming elements. Play as a ghost who looks as dead on the outside as he is on the inside, making demons your weapons on a journey to fix your tv.</description>

  <history>I started developing Demons Happened as a hobby project in 2016. For questionable reasons I decided to build my own engine, which resulted in a 6 years adventure that I'm extremely proud of... with a LOT of learnings. The idea stemmed when I first started learning about game development, finding funny how the only difference between the player object and the enemies is just in what controls them.</history>
