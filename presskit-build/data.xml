  <description>Italian solo dev, based in Amsterdam, delusional enough to build his games on an in-house engine, still convinced that the world needs more games with a bird's-eye view.</description>

  <!-- Choose between a single block: -->
  <history>I started making games with Game Maker in middle school, jumping from project to project without a real focus, mostly for fun. I decided to build my own engine in C++ afterwards as a way to learn a proper programming language, improving, rebuilding, and testing random features in my spare time.
  In 2016, I finally decided to commit to a single game and bring it to completion, developing Demons Happened as a hobby while working full time as a Software Engineer.</history>
